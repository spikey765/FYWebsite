In set theory, the union of sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, contains all elements that are present in set A, set B, or both. The resulting union set does not contain duplicate elements, ensuring that each element appears only once in the combined set.",
            "The intersection of two sets is an operation that identifies and retains only the common elements shared by both sets. In set theory, the intersection of sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, consists of all elements that are present in both set A and set B. The resulting intersection set contains only the elements that are mutually exclusive to both sets, effectively highlighting their shared characteristics.", 
            "The complement of a set is an operation that identifies all the elements not included in a specific set within a universal set. In set theory, if U represents the universal set and A is a subset of U, then the complement of set A, denoted as A', consists of all elements in U that are not in A. The resulting complement set complements the elements of set A within the universal set, providing a clear distinction between the two sets.", 
            "The relative complement, also known as the set difference, is an operation that identifies the elements in one set that are not present in another set. In set theory, the relative complement of set A with respect to set B, denoted as B \\ A, contains all elements that are in set B but not in set A. The resulting relative complement set emphasizes the unique elements of set B that do not overlap with set A, providing insight into the differences between the two sets."

    <div class="parallax"></div>
    <div id="intro">Data types are foundational elements in programming that define the nature and characteristics of data within a system. They specify the type of values that can be assigned to variables and dictate the operations that can be performed on them. Data types used in this course include (but not limited to) integers, strings, booleans and sets.</div>
    <div class="white">
        <h1>Integers</h1>
        <p id="examples">1, -1, 0, 1421, ...</p>
        <p id="description">An integer is a data type used to represent <b>whole numbers</b> without any fractional or decimal components. Integers <b>can be positive, negative, or zero</b> and are typically stored in memory using a fixed amount of space. They are fundamental for <b>arithmetic operations, counting, indexing, and various computational tasks</b>, serving as a basic building block for a wide range of applications and algorithms.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Booleans</h1>
    <p id="examples">True, False</p>
    <p id="description">In computer science, a boolean is a data type that represents two possible values: <b>true or false</b>. Booleans are used to <b>make logical decisions, control the flow of programs, and evaluate conditions</b>. They occupy a minimal amount of memory and play a <b>crucial role in conditional statements, loops, and boolean algebra</b> operations within algorithms and applications.</p>
    <div class="white">
        <h1>Characters</h1>
        <p id="examples">'a', '1', '!', ...</p>
        <p id="description">A character is a <b>single unit of text</b> or data that can <b>represent a letter, number or symbol</b>. Characters are the basic building blocks <b>used to create strings</b>, which are sequences of characters. Each character is typically encoded using a specific character encoding scheme, such as ASCII or Unicode, to represent it as a binary value that can be stored and manipulated by a computer.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Strings</h1>
    <p id="examples">"Hello World!", "123", "!", ...</p>
    <p id="description">In computer science, a string is a data type that represents a <b>sequence of characters</b>, often used to <b>store and manipulate text-based information</b>. Strings are fundamental in programming for tasks like input/output operations, text processing, and data representation. Individual characters can be referenced by treating a string as an <b>array of characters</b>.</p>
    <div class="white">
        <h1>Arrays</h1>
        <p id="examples">a = {1, 2}, b = {"ab", "cd"}, c = {}, ...</p>
        <p id="description">An array is a data structure that <b>stores a collection of elements</b>, each <b>identified by an index</b>. Arrays are typically used to <b>store data of the same type</b>, such as integers or characters, and provide efficient access to individual elements based on their position (index) in the array.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Sets</h1>
    <p id="examples">S = (1, 2, 3), B = ('a', 'b', 'c'), E = ∅, ...</p>
    <p id="description">In mathematics and computer science, a set is a <b>collection of distinct elements without any specific order</b>. Sets are used to group related items or data points and are characterized by their members, which can be numbers, objects, or other types of data. Operations like <b>union, intersection, and difference</b> can be performed on sets to combine, compare, or modify their contents.</p>
